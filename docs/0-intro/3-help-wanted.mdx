# Hacker UI Needs You

Hacker UI is in an early alpha state. There's still a lot to do, optimize, and think about!

In the next few days, I'll put up a list of issued marked `help wanted` in the repo, but for now would you mind showing your support via a star on GitHub?

It may sound cliche, but stars help determine demand and traction. In open source, traction attracts talent and brings us together <Emoji>❤️</Emoji>.

<Button
  variant="filled"
  color="black"
  component="a"
  href="https://github.com/ricokahler/hacker-ui/issues/6"
  style={{ margin: '0 auto' }}
>
  <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faGithub} size="lg" /> <span>GitHub</span>
</Button>
