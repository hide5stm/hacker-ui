# Modals and Drawers

## Modals

Modals in Hacker UI are very composable with 5 components:

- Modal
- ModalHeader
- ModalContent
- ModalFooter
- ModalActions

<ModalExample />

Currently the Modal is only limited to one size. This will change soon!

## Drawers

This drawer is incredibly basic and need some improvements.
